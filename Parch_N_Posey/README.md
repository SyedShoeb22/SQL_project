# SQL Project Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This repository contains a SQL project that demonstrate my skills and experience in working with databases, querying data, and performing data analysis using SQL.

## Projects

1. Parch-and-Posey: Developed a comprehensive SQL analysis project using the Parch and Posey dataset to extract valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making. Explored complex queries to gain a deeper understanding of the company's sales and customer data.
   - Technologies Used: SQL, Database Management System (DBMS)
   - Key Features:
       - Data Analysis: The project involves performing data analysis on various tables, such as orders, accounts, and web_events, using SQL queries. The queries help extract meaningful insights and derive useful information from the data.

      - Joins: The project demonstrates the usage of JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables. It showcases different types of joins, including INNER JOIN, to retrieve data based on common columns between tables.

      - Filtering and Sorting: The project includes queries that utilize WHERE clauses to filter data based on specific conditions. It also demonstrates sorting the query results using ORDER BY, both in ascending and descending order.

      - Aggregation: The project showcases the use of aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to calculate aggregate values from numeric columns. These functions are utilized to derive meaningful metrics and statistics from the data.
   - Code Samples: select occurred_at, account_id, channel from web_events limit 15;

## Getting Started

To explore these projects locally or run the SQL queries, you will need the following:

- Database Management System (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- SQL client or IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver)

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/SyedShoeb22/SQL_project.git

3. Set up the database:
- Create a new database in your DBMS.
- Import the project's database schema and data into your DBMS.

3. Open your SQL client or IDE and connect to the database.

4. Explore the project folders and open the SQL files to view the queries and code.
